Farmers often need tools for **short-term or seasonal work**, making outright purchase impractical.

- Enabling **tool sharing and rentals** at affordable rates.  
- Helping farmers **earn extra income** by renting out unused equipment.  
- Encouraging **sustainable and cost-efficient farming practices**.  
- Creating a **centralized online platform** where the farming community can connect directly.
